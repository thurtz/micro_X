# **3. AI Features**

The core of micro_X is its ability to integrate AI to translate, validate, and explain commands.

## **AI Translation**

micro_X can translate your natural language queries into shell commands in two ways:

1.  **Automatic Translation**: If you enter a query that is not a known command, micro_X will automatically treat it as a natural language query and attempt to translate it into a shell command.
2.  **Forced Translation (`/translate` command)**: To explicitly tell micro_X to treat your query as a natural language command, prefix it with `/translate`.

    *   *Example*: `/translate show me all files larger than 10MB in the current directory`
    *   *Example*: `/translate what is my current IP address`

In both cases, micro_X will send your query to the AI, which will attempt to translate it into a valid command.

## **Command Confirmation Flow**

For any command generated by the AI, you will be prompted to confirm its execution. This is a critical safety feature.
```
🤖 AI proposed command (from: /translate your query -> suggested_command):
👉 suggested_command
Action:
  [1] Yes (Exec, prompt if new)
  [2] Simple & Run
  [3] Semi-Interactive & Run
  [4] TUI & Run
  [5] Explain
  [6] Modify
  [7] Cancel
[Confirm AI Cmd] Choice (1-7):
```

Your options are:

* **[1] Yes**: Execute the command. If the command is new, you'll be asked to categorize it next.
* **[2] / [3] / [4]**: Execute the command AND categorize it as simple, semi_interactive, or interactive_tui respectively.
* **[5] Explain**: Ask the AI to explain what the command does. You will be prompted again to confirm after the explanation.
* **[6] Modify**: Load the suggested command into the input field, allowing you to edit it before execution.
* **[7] Cancel**: Abort the execution. The command will not run.

## **AI-Powered Validation**

When you type a command that micro_X hasn't seen before, it will first use an AI model to validate whether the input is a plausible command or a natural language phrase.

* If it looks like a command, it proceeds to the categorization flow.  
* If it looks like a phrase, micro_X will attempt to translate it as if you had used the /translate prefix, triggering the command confirmation flow.
