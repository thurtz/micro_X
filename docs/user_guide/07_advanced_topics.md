## **7\. Advanced Topics**

This section covers details about how micro\_X interacts with other tools and how its configuration is structured.

### **Working with tmux**

micro\_X uses tmux (a terminal multiplexer) to run commands categorized as semi\_interactive or interactive\_tui.

* **interactive\_tui commands** (e.g., nano, htop):  
  * Your terminal will switch to show the interactive application in a new tmux window.  
  * To return to micro\_X, simply exit the application normally (e.g., Ctrl+X in nano).  
* **semi\_interactive commands** (e.g., ping google.com):  
  * These run in a tmux window, usually in the background.  
  * Their output is captured and displayed in the micro\_X UI after the command completes or times out.

You can manually attach to a running micro\_X tmux session from another terminal if needed using tmux attach-session \-t \<session\_name\>.

### **Security Considerations**

* **AI-Generated Commands**: While micro\_X includes AI validation, **AI can still generate unexpected or potentially harmful commands.**  
  * **Review and Understand**: Always use the **\[E\]xplain** option in the command confirmation flow if you are unsure about a command's function.  
  * **Modify or Cancel**: Do not hesitate to **\[M\]odify** commands to your exact needs or **\[C\]ancel** them if they seem suspicious.  
* **User Responsibility**: You are ultimately responsible for the commands executed in your environment.

### **Configuration Files**

micro\_X uses a hierarchical configuration system located in the config/ directory.

* config/default\_config.json: The base configuration file. **Do not edit this file**, as it may be overwritten by updates. Use it as a reference.  
* config/user\_config.json: Your personal configuration file. Any setting you place here will **override** the default. This is the correct place to customize AI models, timeouts, and other behaviors.  
* config/default\_command\_categories.json: A list of pre-categorized common commands.  
* config/user\_command\_categories.json: Your personal command categorizations, managed via the /command subsystem.
