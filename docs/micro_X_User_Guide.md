## **micro\_X User Guide**

Welcome to the micro\_X User Guide\! This document provides detailed information on using micro\_X, including its AI features, command categorization, command confirmation, Ollama service management, interaction with tmux for certain command types, and the new branch-aware developer mode and code integrity checks.

### **1\. Introduction to micro\_X**

micro\_X is an AI-enhanced shell designed to make your command-line experience more intuitive and powerful. It allows you to:

* Execute standard Linux commands.  
* Translate natural language queries into commands using /ai.  
* Benefit from AI-powered validation of commands.  
* Review, get AI explanations for, modify, or cancel AI-generated commands before execution.  
* Categorize commands for optimal execution, especially for interactive or long-running tasks which are handled via tmux.  
* Manage the Ollama service directly from within micro\_X.  
* **Run with confidence:** micro\_X performs startup integrity checks on main and testing branches and offers an automatic "Developer Mode" on the dev branch.

### **2\. Getting Started**

#### **2.1. Choosing a Branch**

* **For most users, the main branch is recommended.** This branch contains the most stable version of micro\_X.  
* The testing branch is used for features that are being prepared for a stable release. It's generally stable but might have newer, less-tested features.  
* The dev branch is for active development and may contain experimental features or be unstable at times.

#### **2.2. Installation and Setup**

Before using micro\_X, ensure it has been properly installed and configured. Please refer to the main README.md file in the project root or run the ./setup.sh script (also in the project root) for detailed setup instructions tailored to your operating system.

* **Important:** For full functionality, including the developer mode and integrity checks, micro\_X should be run from a git clone of the repository, and the git command must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

#### **2.3. Managing Multiple Branch Installations (Optional)**

If you wish to work with or test different branches of micro\_X simultaneously without them interfering with each other, you can clone the repository into separate directories. This is particularly useful for developers or advanced users.

1. **Clone for main branch (Stable):**  
   git clone https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git micro\_X-main  
   cd micro\_X-main  
   git checkout main \# Usually already on main by default  
   ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory

2. **Clone for testing branch:**  
   git clone https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git micro\_X-testing  
   cd micro\_X-testing  
   git checkout testing  
   ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory

3. **Clone for dev branch (Development):**  
   git clone https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git micro\_X-dev  
   cd micro\_X-dev  
   git checkout dev  
   ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory

Each of these directories (micro\_X-main, micro\_X-testing, micro\_X-dev) will then be an independent installation with its own virtual environment and configuration.

#### **2.4. Launching micro\_X**

* Recommended Method (./micro\_X.sh):  
  From the terminal, navigate to your chosen micro\_X directory (e.g., cd micro\_X-main) and run ./micro\_X.sh. This script is the preferred way to launch micro\_X as it:  
  1. Activates the Python virtual environment.  
  2. Starts micro\_X (i.e., main.py) inside a dedicated tmux session (usually named micro\_X). This provides the most integrated experience.  
* **Desktop Shortcut (Linux Mint):** If you used the setup script and installed the desktop entry, clicking "micro\_X" in your application menu will typically run the micro\_X.sh script from the directory it was installed from.  
* **Manual Method:** You can run micro\_X directly by following these steps:  
  1. Navigate to its directory.  
  2. Activate the virtual environment:  
     source .venv/bin/activate

  3. Launch a tmux session specific for micro\_X: tmux \-f config/.tmux.conf new-session \-A \-s micro\_X

**Note on tmux features with manual launch outside of the micro\_X tmux session:** If you launch main.py directly (without step 3, or outside the session started by micro\_X.sh), micro\_X itself will not be running inside a tmux session. However, commands categorized as semi\_interactive or interactive\_tui will still attempt to launch in new, independent tmux windows/sessions. The main.py micro\_X shell may not function on its own outside of a tmux environment launched specifically for its own setup.

#### **2.5. Startup Behavior (Integrity Checks & Developer Mode)**

micro\_X checks the current Git branch on startup to determine its operational mode. See section "5. Developer Mode & Code Integrity" for full details.

#### **2.6. Ensuring Ollama is Ready**

Before using AI features, ensure Ollama is running. You can check this within micro\_X using the /ollama status command (see section 4.5).

#### **2.7. The Interface**

* **Output Area:** The top, larger pane displays command output, AI messages, and logs. It's scrollable.  
* **Input Area:** The bottom pane with a prompt (e.g., (\~) \>) is where you type your commands or /ai queries.  
* **Key Help Bar:** A single line at the very bottom shows common keybindings.

### **3\. micro\_X Keybindings**

micro\_X uses several keybindings for efficient operation:

* **Enter**: Submits the current command or query in the input field.  
* **Ctrl+C / Ctrl+D**:  
  * In normal input mode: Exits micro\_X.  
  * During an interactive categorization or command confirmation prompt: Cancels the current flow and returns to the normal input prompt.  
* **Ctrl+N**: Inserts a newline in the input field.  
* **Up Arrow / Down Arrow**:  
  * In the input field: Navigates through your command history.  
  * If the input field has multiple lines of text: Navigates up/down through those lines.  
* **Tab**:  
  * Attempts command completion.  
  * If no completion is available, inserts 4 spaces for indentation.  
* **PageUp / PageDown**: Scrolls the main output area up or down.  
* **Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down**: Moves the cursor up or down one line within the input field.

### **4\. Core micro\_X Usage**

#### **4.1. Executing Standard Linux Commands**

Simply type any Linux command (e.g., ls \-l, echo "hello world", git status) and press Enter. The output will appear in the output area.

#### **4.2. Using AI Translation (/ai command) & Command Confirmation**

To translate a natural language query into a command:

1. Type /ai followed by your query.  
   * Example: /ai show me all files larger than 10MB in the current directory  
   * Example: /ai what is my current IP address  
2. Press Enter.  
3. micro\_X will:  
   * Send your query to the configured AI translator(s).  
   * The translated command will be validated by another AI model.  
   * You'll see messages like "ðŸ¤– AI Query: ...", "ðŸ§  Thinking...", "ðŸ¤– AI Suggests (validated): ...".  
4. **Command Confirmation Flow**: If the AI successfully generates and validates a command, you will be prompted to confirm its execution:  
   ðŸ¤– AI proposed command (from: /ai your query \-\> suggested\_command):  
      ðŸ‘‰ suggested\_command  
   Action: \[Y\]es (Exec, prompt if new) | \[Ys\] Simple & Run | \[Ym\] Semi-Interactive & Run | \[Yi\] TUI & Run | \[E\]xplain | \[M\]odify | \[C\]ancel?  
   \[Confirm AI Cmd\] Choice (Y/Ys/Ym/Yi/E/M/C): 

   Your options are:  
   * **Y** or **yes**: Execute the command. If the command is unknown to micro\_X's categorization system, you will be prompted to categorize it next (see section 4.3).  
   * **Ys**: Execute the command AND categorize it as simple.  
   * **Ym**: Execute the command AND categorize it as semi\_interactive.  
   * **Yi**: Execute the command AND categorize it as interactive\_tui.  
   * **E** or **explain**: Ask the AI to explain what the suggested\_command does. After the explanation, you will be prompted again to execute, modify, or cancel.  
     ðŸ§  Asking AI to explain: suggested\_command  
     ðŸ’¡ AI Explanation:  
     The command 'suggested\_command' does XYZ...  
     Command to consider: suggested\_command  
     Action: \[Y\]es (Exec, prompt if new) | \[Ys\] Simple & Run | \[Ym\] Semi-Interactive & Run | \[Yi\] TUI & Run | \[M\]odify | \[C\]ancel?  
     \[Confirm AI Cmd\] Choice (Y/Ys/Ym/Yi/M/C): 

   * **M** or **modify**: The suggested\_command will be loaded into your input field, allowing you to edit it before pressing Enter to submit the modified version.  
   * **C** or **cancel** (or **N** or **no**): Abort the execution. The command will not run.

#### **4.3. Command Categorization (for unknown direct commands or AI commands confirmed with 'Y')**

When micro\_X encounters a command it hasn't seen before (either typed directly, or an AI-generated command confirmed with a simple 'Y' that isn't yet categorized), it will prompt you to categorize it. This helps micro\_X run the command appropriately.

* **Categories**:  
  * **simple**: For commands that run quickly, produce non-interactive output, and don't require a persistent terminal session (e.g., ls, echo, cat somefile.txt). Chained commands like ls \-l | grep .txt are also often suitable here. These are executed directly, and their output is captured in the micro\_X output area.  
  * **semi\_interactive**: For commands that might run for a while, produce a lot of output, or have some minimal interactivity that doesn't require full TUI control (e.g., apt update, a long script, ping google.com). These are run in a new tmux window. Their output is captured and displayed in micro\_X after the command finishes or after a configurable poll timeout (tmux\_poll\_seconds in your config) is reached.  
    * **Smart Output Handling**: If a semi\_interactive command produces output resembling a full-screen TUI application, micro\_X avoids displaying garbled output and suggests re-categorizing to interactive\_tui.  
  * **interactive\_tui**: For fully interactive terminal applications (e.g., nano, vim, htop, ssh user@host). These are run in a new tmux window that micro\_X effectively hands control to. When you exit the application (and thus the tmux window), you'll return to micro\_X.  
* **Categorization Prompt** (Example for a directly typed unknown command):  
  Command 'my\_new\_script.sh \--verbose' is not categorized. Choose an action:  
  1: simple           (Direct output in micro\_X)  
  2: semi\_interactive (Output in micro\_X after tmux run (may be interactive))  
  3: interactive\_tui  (Full interactive tmux session)  
  M: Modify command before categorizing  
  D: Execute as default 'semi\_interactive' (once, no save)  
  C: Cancel categorization & execution  
  \[Categorize\] Action (1-3/M/D/C): 

  Enter your choice. If you choose 1, 2, or 3, the command and its category will be saved in config/user\_command\_categories.json.

#### **4.4. Managing Command Categories (/command subsystem)**

You can manage your saved command categorizations:

* **/command list**: Shows all categorized commands (merged view of defaults and user settings).  
* **/command add "\<full\_command\_string\>" \<category\_name\_or\_number\>**: Adds a new command or updates an existing one.  
  * Example: /command add "htop" interactive\_tui  
  * Example: /command add "my\_backup\_script.sh" 2 (for semi\_interactive)  
* **/command remove "\<full\_command\_string\>"**: Removes a command from your explicit user categorizations. It may then revert to a default category or become unknown.  
* **/command move "\<full\_command\_string\>" \<new\_category\_name\_or\_number\>**: Moves a command to a different category in your settings.  
* **/command run \<cat\_num|cat\_name\> "\<command\>"**: Force runs a command with a specific category for this instance without saving the categorization.  
  * Example: /command run simple "echo 'This will run as simple just once'"  
* /command help: Shows these usage instructions and category descriptions.  
  Remember to quote command strings if they contain spaces.

#### **4.5. Managing the Ollama Service (/ollama command)**

micro\_X provides commands to manage the Ollama service it relies on for AI features:

* **/ollama status**: Shows the current status of the Ollama executable, API responsiveness, the managed tmux session for ollama serve, and auto-start configuration.  
* **/ollama start**: Attempts to start the managed ollama serve process in a tmux session if it's not already running and responsive.  
* **/ollama stop**: Attempts to stop the managed ollama serve tmux session.  
* **/ollama restart**: Attempts to stop and then restart the managed ollama serve process.  
* **/ollama help**: Displays help information for these subcommands.

#### **4.6. Managing Runtime AI Configuration (/config command)**

You can view and modify parts of the AI configuration without restarting micro\_X.

* **/config list**: Shows the current models and any specific options (e.g., temperature) set for each AI role (translator, validator, explainer).  
* **/config get \<key.path\>**: Displays the value of a specific configuration key.  
  * Example: /config get ai\_models.primary\_translator.model  
* **/config set \<key.path\> \<value\>**: Sets a new value for a configuration key at runtime.  
  * Example: /config set ai\_models.explainer.model llama3:latest  
  * Example: /config set ai\_models.primary\_translator.options.temperature 0.5  
  * **Note**: For safety, this runtime command is limited to modifying keys within the ai\_models section of your configuration.  
* **/config save**: Saves the current runtime ai\_models configurations to your user\_config.json file, making them persistent.  
* **/config help**: Shows usage instructions for these subcommands.

#### **4.7. Using Utility Scripts (/utils command)**

micro\_X comes with helpful utility scripts located in the utils/ directory.

* **/utils list**: Displays a list of available utility scripts.  
* **/utils \<script\_name\> \[args...\]**: Executes the specified utility script.  
  * Example: /utils generate\_tree  
  * Example: /utils generate\_snapshot \--summary "My snapshot"  
* **Web Config Manager**: A key utility is the web-based configuration manager.  
  * Example: /utils config\_manager \--start  
    This will start a local web server (in a managed tmux session) and open a web page in your browser, allowing you to easily view and edit user\_config.json and user\_command\_categories.json.  
* **/utils \<script\_name\> help** (or **\-h**, **\--help**): Displays the help message for a specific utility script, showing its available arguments.  
  * Example: /utils generate\_snapshot help

#### **4.8. Chained Commands**

micro\_X supports AI translation and execution of chained commands (e.g., ls \-l | grep .txt && echo "Found").

* When categorized, the entire chained command is treated as a single entity.  
* The "dominant" category usually applies. If any part of a chain requires interactive\_tui (like nano), the whole chain will likely run best under interactive\_tui.

### **5\. Developer Mode & Code Integrity**

To enhance reliability and security, micro\_X implements a branch-aware system for developer mode and code integrity checks.

* **Purpose:** This system aims to ensure that users running micro\_X from its stable (main) or testing branches are using verified and synchronized code. For developers, it provides a seamless experience on the development (dev) branch.  
* **Developer Mode (dev branch)**:  
  * **Activation:** Automatically activated when micro\_X detects it is running from the dev Git branch, or if Git context is unavailable (e.g., not a Git repository).  
  * **Behavior:** In this mode, startup integrity checks are informational or bypassed. micro\_X will run even if there are local uncommitted changes or if the dev branch has diverged from its remote counterpart.  
  * **Intention:** This mode is designed for active development.  
* **Protected Mode (main and testing branches)**:  
  * **Activation:** Active when micro\_X detects it is running from the main or testing Git branches.  
  * **Integrity Checks Performed at Startup:**  
    1. **Clean Working Directory:** Verifies no uncommitted modifications to tracked files and no untracked files (not ignored by .gitignore).  
    2. **Sync with Remote:** Verifies the local branch is synchronized with its remote-tracking branch on origin. micro\_X attempts to git fetch for an up-to-date comparison.  
  * **Consequences of Failure:**  
    * If critical integrity issues are found (e.g., uncommitted local changes, local branch ahead of or diverged from remote), micro\_X will display an error message and halt execution. If the UI closes too quickly to read the message, check logs/micro\_x.log for details.  
    * If the local branch is merely behind the remote (and allow\_run\_if\_behind\_remote is true in the configuration, which is the default), a warning will be displayed, and /update will be suggested. micro\_X will continue to run in this case.  
  * **User Action on Failure:** See section "8. Troubleshooting Common Issues".  
* **Behavior on Other Branches/States**:  
  * **Feature Branches** (not dev, main, testing): Assumes a developer-like mode; integrity checks are informational and do not halt execution.  
  * **Detached HEAD State:** Similar to other branches, assumes developer mode.  
* **Behavior if Not a Git Repository or git is Unavailable**:  
  * A warning message will be displayed.  
  * Integrity checks will be disabled.  
  * micro\_X will operate in a mode similar to "Developer Mode."

### **6\. Working with tmux (for semi\_interactive and interactive\_tui commands)**

micro\_X uses tmux (a terminal multiplexer) to run commands categorized as semi\_interactive or interactive\_tui.

* If micro\_X was launched with ./micro\_X.sh (Recommended):  
  * micro\_X itself runs inside a main tmux session (e.g., named micro\_X).  
  * semi\_interactive and interactive\_tui commands will create new windows within this main session.  
* If micro\_X was launched with python3 main.py directly:  
  * semi\_interactive and interactive\_tui commands will create *new, independent tmux sessions* or not work at all.

**Behavior of tmux-based commands:**

* **interactive\_tui commands** (e.g., nano, htop):  
  * Your terminal will switch to show the interactive application in a new tmux window.  
  * **Exiting:** Exit the application normally (e.g., Ctrl+X in nano) to close the tmux window and return to micro\_X.  
* **semi\_interactive commands** (e.g., ping google.com):  
  * These run in a tmux window, usually in the background.  
  * Output is captured and displayed in micro\_X after completion or timeout.

#### **6.1. Basic tmux Interaction (If you need to manually intervene)**

The tmux prefix key is Ctrl+b by default.

* **Listing tmux Sessions & Windows:**  
  * From any terminal: tmux ls (lists sessions)  
  * Inside a tmux session: tmux list-windows (lists windows in current session)  
  * From outside, for a specific session: tmux list-windows \-t micro\_X  
* **Attaching to a tmux Session:** tmux attach-session \-t micro\_X  
* **Detaching from Current tmux Session:** Ctrl+b, then d.  
* **Switching Windows (within tmux):** Ctrl+b then p (previous), n (next), or a window number (0, 1, ...).

#### **6.2. Killing tmux Windows or Panes**

If a command in a tmux window becomes unresponsive:

1. **Identify Target:** For interactive\_tui, you're likely in it. For semi\_interactive, list windows/sessions to find its name (e.g., micro\_x\_xxxx).  
2. **Kill Current Window/Pane (if inside):** Try Ctrl+C in the app. If unresponsive, Ctrl+b then x (confirm with y).  
3. **Kill Specific Window by Name/ID:** tmux kill-window \-t \<window\_index\_or\_name\>

#### **6.3. Handling Processes that Lock Up tmux Windows**

1. **Identify PID:** Detach from tmux (Ctrl+b d). Use ps aux | grep \<command\_name\> or htop in a standard terminal.  
2. **Kill Process:** kill \<PID\> (or kill \-9 \<PID\> with caution).  
3. **Clean tmux Window:** The tmux window might show "Pane is dead." Close it with Ctrl+b x.

### **7\. Security Considerations**

* **AI-Generated Commands:** While micro\_X includes AI validation and a basic command sanitizer, **AI can still generate unexpected or potentially harmful commands.**  
  * **Review and Understand:** **Crucially, always use the \[E\]xplain option** in the command confirmation flow (section 4.2) for any AI-generated command if you are unsure about its function or impact.  
* **Modify or Cancel:** Do not hesitate to \[M\]odify commands to your exact needs or \[C\]ancel them if they seem suspicious or incorrect.  
* **Startup Integrity Checks:** The checks on main and testing branches provide an added layer of assurance. When these checks halt the application, it's a signal to review your local repository's state.  
* **User Responsibility:** You are ultimately responsible for the commands executed in your environment.

### **8\. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

* **"Ollama Connection Error" / AI Features Not Working:**  
  * Ensure the Ollama application/service is running. Use /ollama status.  
  * If not running, try /ollama start.  
  * For WSL: Check OLLAMA\_HOST environment variable and Windows Firewall.  
* **AI Translations are Poor:**  
  * Rephrase /ai queries.  
  * Ensure correct Ollama models are pulled and accessible.  
* **tmux Errors:** Ensure tmux is installed and in your PATH.  
* **Command Categorized Incorrectly:** Use /command move or /command remove.  
* **micro\_X halts on startup with "Integrity Check Failed" (on main or testing branch):**  
  * **Message:** "Uncommitted local changes or untracked files detected."  
    * **Reason:** You have uncommitted local modifications or new untracked files.  
    * **Solution:** Open a standard terminal in your micro\_X project directory. Run git status. Commit, stash (git stash), or discard changes (git reset \--hard HEAD \- warning: discards uncommitted changes). For development, switch to the dev branch (git checkout dev).  
  * **Message:** "Local branch has 'ahead'/'diverged' from 'origin/'." or "Local branch is behind 'origin/'." (Note: "behind" with allow\_run\_if\_behind\_remote: true will only warn, but you might want to sync.)  
    * **Reason:** Your local branch is not synchronized with the remote. It might have local commits not on the remote, the remote might have new commits, or both might have diverged. For main and testing, your local branch should typically mirror the remote.  
    * **Solution:**  
      1. Fetch latest remote data: git fetch origin  
      2. Choose a synchronization strategy:  
         * To update and align your local branch (recommended for main/testing if behind or slightly diverged, aiming for linear history):  
           git checkout \<branch\_name\>  \# e.g., testing or main  
           git rebase origin/\<branch\_name\>

           This replays any (unexpected) local commits on top of the latest remote version. If there are no local commits, it fast-forwards your branch. Conflicts may need to be resolved if local commits existed and conflict with remote changes. A common shortcut for fetch then rebase is: git pull \--rebase origin \<branch\_name\>  
         * To force your local branch to exactly match the remote, discarding ALL local differences (commits and uncommitted changes on this branch):  
           This is often the simplest solution if your local main or testing branch has commits it shouldn't or is ahead/diverged and you just want it to mirror the remote.  
           git checkout \<branch\_name\>  \# e.g., testing or main  
           git reset \--hard origin/\<branch\_name\>

           **Use reset \--hard with extreme caution** as it permanently discards local work on the branch.  
         * If you were ahead with commits that are valid and should be on the remote main or testing (unusual for this workflow, usually means a PR was missed):  
           Consult your team. Pushing directly to protected branches is often restricted. Usually, these changes should go through the dev \-\> testing \-\> main PR process. If you need to preserve these commits locally while resetting, consider creating a new branch from your current main/testing before resetting: git branch my-backup-branch  
  * **Message:** "Cannot reliably compare with remote. Status: no\_upstream/fetch\_failed/error."  
    * **Reason & Solution:** Check internet, git branch \-vv for upstream tracking, git fetch origin for errors. Consult logs/micro\_x.log.  
  * If micro\_X closes too quickly to read the error message on startup, **always check logs/micro\_x.log for detailed error information.**  
* **micro\_X shows warnings about being "behind remote" (on main or testing branch):**  
  * **Reason:** The remote repository has updates that your local branch does not.  
  * **Solution:** Run /update from within micro\_X, or open a standard terminal in the project directory and run git pull origin \<branch\_name\>. micro\_X will typically continue to run in this scenario (if allow\_run\_if\_behind\_remote is true).

### **9\. Configuration Details**

micro\_X uses a powerful and flexible configuration system. While some settings can be changed at runtime with /config, most are managed by editing JSON files in the config/ directory.

* **config/default\_config.json**: The base configuration file. **Do not edit this file**, as it may be overwritten by updates. Use it as a reference for available settings.  
* **config/user\_config.json**: Your personal configuration file. Any setting you place here will **override** the default. This is the correct place to customize AI models, timeouts, and behavior.  
* **config/default\_command\_categories.json**: A list of pre-categorized commands.  
* **config/user\_command\_categories.json**: Your personal command categorizations, managed via the /command subsystem.

#### **Notable Configuration Setting: use\_strict\_extraction**

A key setting in user\_config.json (under the behavior section) that you might want to adjust is use\_strict\_extraction\_for\_primary\_translator.

* When set to true (the default for some models), micro\_X will strictly look for commands inside \<bash\>...\</bash\> tags from the primary AI translator. This is reliable for models trained to use these tags.  
* When set to false, it treats the AI's entire output as the potential command. This can improve compatibility with models that are good at generating commands but don't consistently use the specific tags.

This guide should help you navigate and utilize the features of micro\_X more effectively. Happy shelling\!
