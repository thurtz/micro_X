\#\# \*\*micro\_X User Guide\*\*

Welcome to the micro\_X User Guide\! This document provides detailed information on using micro\_X, including its AI features, command categorization, command confirmation, Ollama service management, interaction with tmux for certain command types, and the new branch-aware developer mode and code integrity checks.

\#\#\# \*\*1. Introduction to micro\_X\*\*

micro\_X is an AI-enhanced shell designed to make your command-line experience more intuitive and powerful. It allows you to:

\* Execute standard Linux commands.  
\* Translate natural language queries into commands using /ai.  
\* Benefit from AI-powered validation of commands.  
\* Review, get AI explanations for, modify, or cancel AI-generated commands before execution.  
\* Categorize commands for optimal execution, especially for interactive or long-running tasks which are handled via tmux.  
\* Manage the Ollama service directly from within micro\_X.  
\* \*\*Run with confidence:\*\* micro\_X performs startup integrity checks on main and testing branches and offers an automatic "Developer Mode" on the dev branch.

\#\#\# \*\*2. Getting Started\*\*

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.1. Choosing a Branch\*\*

\* \*\*For most users, the \`main\` branch is recommended.\*\* This branch contains the most stable version of micro\_X.  
\* The \`testing\` branch is used for features that are being prepared for a stable release. It's generally stable but might have newer, less-tested features.  
\* The \`dev\` branch is for active development and may contain experimental features or be unstable at times.

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.2. Installation and Setup\*\*

Before using micro\_X, ensure it has been properly installed and configured. Please refer to the main README.md file in the project root or run the \`./setup.sh\` script (also in the project root) for detailed setup instructions tailored to your operating system.

\* \*\*Important:\*\* For full functionality, including the developer mode and integrity checks, micro\_X should be run from a git clone of the repository, and the \`git\` command must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.3. Managing Multiple Branch Installations (Optional)\*\*

If you wish to work with or test different branches of micro\_X simultaneously without them interfering with each other, you can clone the repository into separate directories. This is particularly useful for developers or advanced users.

1\.  \*\*Clone for \`main\` branch (Stable):\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git clone \[https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git\](https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git) micro\_X-main  
    cd micro\_X-main  
    \# git checkout main \# Usually already on main after clone  
    ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory  
    \`\`\`  
2\.  \*\*Clone for \`testing\` branch:\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git clone \[https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git\](https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git) micro\_X-testing  
    cd micro\_X-testing  
    git checkout testing  
    ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory  
    \`\`\`  
3\.  \*\*Clone for \`dev\` branch (Development):\*\*  
    \`\`\`bash  
    git clone \[https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git\](https://github.com/thurtz/micro\_X.git) micro\_X-dev  
    cd micro\_X-dev  
    git checkout dev  
    ./setup.sh \# Run setup within this directory  
    \`\`\`  
Each of these directories (\`micro\_X-main\`, \`micro\_X-testing\`, \`micro\_X-dev\`) will then be an independent installation with its own virtual environment and configuration (though you might share user-level config if not careful, it's generally best to treat them as separate).

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.4. Launching micro\_X\*\*

\* \*\*Recommended Method (\`./micro\_X.sh\`):\*\*  
    From the terminal, navigate to your chosen micro\_X directory (e.g., \`cd micro\_X-main\`) and run \`./micro\_X.sh\`. This script is the preferred way to launch micro\_X as it:  
    1\.  Activates the Python virtual environment.  
    2\.  Starts micro\_X (i.e., \`main.py\`) \*inside a dedicated tmux session\* (usually named \`micro\_X\`). This provides the most integrated experience.  
\* \*\*Desktop Shortcut (Linux Mint):\*\* If you used the setup script and installed the desktop entry, clicking "micro\_X" in your application menu will typically run the \`micro\_X.sh\` script from the directory it was installed from.  
\* \*\*Manual Method (\`python3 main.py\`):\*\* You can run micro\_X directly by navigating to its directory, activating the virtual environment (\`source .venv/bin/activate\`), launching a tmux session specific for micro\_X (\`tmux \-f config/.tmux.conf new-session \-A \-s micro\_X\`), and then running \`python3 main.py\`. Note on tmux features with manual launch outside of the micro\_X tmux session: If you launch \`main.py\` directly, micro\_X itself will not be running inside a tmux session. However, commands categorized as \`semi\_interactive\` or \`interactive\_tui\` will still attempt to launch in new, independent tmux windows/sessions.

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.5. Startup Behavior (Integrity Checks & Developer Mode)\*\*

micro\_X checks the current Git branch on startup to determine its operational mode. See section "5. Developer Mode & Code Integrity" for full details.

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.6. Ensuring Ollama is Ready\*\*

Before using AI features, ensure Ollama is running. You can check this within micro\_X using the \`/ollama status\` command (see section 4.5).

\#\#\#\# \*\*2.7. The Interface\*\*

\* \*\*Output Area:\*\* The top, larger pane displays command output, AI messages, and logs. It's scrollable.  
\* \*\*Input Area:\*\* The bottom pane with a prompt (e.g., \`(\~) \>\`) is where you type your commands or \`/ai\` queries.  
\* \*\*Key Help Bar:\*\* A single line at the very bottom shows common keybindings.

\#\#\# \*\*3. micro\_X Keybindings\*\*

micro\_X uses several keybindings for efficient operation:

\* \*\*Enter\*\*: Submits the current command or query in the input field.  
\* \*\*Ctrl+C / Ctrl+D\*\*:  
  \* In normal input mode: Exits micro\_X.  
  \* During an interactive categorization or \*\*command confirmation\*\* prompt: Cancels the current flow and returns to the normal input prompt.  
\* \*\*Ctrl+N\*\*: Inserts a newline in the input field.  
\* \*\*Up Arrow / Down Arrow\*\*:  
  \* In the input field: Navigates through your command history.  
  \* If the input field has multiple lines of text: Navigates up/down through those lines.  
\* \*\*Tab\*\*:  
  \* Attempts command completion.  
  \* If no completion is available, inserts 4 spaces for indentation.  
\* \*\*PageUp / PageDown\*\*: Scrolls the main output area up or down.  
\* \*\*Ctrl+Up / Ctrl+Down\*\*: Moves the cursor up or down one line within the input field.

\#\#\# \*\*4. Core micro\_X Usage\*\*

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.1. Executing Standard Linux Commands\*\*

Simply type any Linux command (e.g., \`ls \-l\`, \`echo "hello world"\`, \`git status\`) and press Enter. The output will appear in the output area.

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.2. Using AI Translation (/ai command) & Command Confirmation\*\*

To translate a natural language query into a command:

1\. Type \`/ai\` followed by your query.  
   \* Example: \`/ai show me all files larger than 10MB in the current directory\`  
   \* Example: \`/ai what is my current IP address\`  
2\. Press Enter.  
3\. micro\_X will:  
   \* Send your query to the configured AI translator(s).  
   \* The translated command will be validated by another AI model.  
   \* You'll see messages like "ðŸ¤– AI Query: ...", "ðŸ§  Thinking...", "ðŸ¤– AI Suggests (validated): ...".  
4\. Command Confirmation Flow: If the AI successfully generates and validates a command, you will be prompted to confirm its execution:

ðŸ¤– AI proposed command (from: /ai your query \-\> suggested\_command):  
ðŸ‘‰ suggested\_command  
Action: \[Y\]es (Exec, prompt if new) | \[Ys\] Simple & Run | \[Ym\] Semi-Interactive & Run | \[Yi\] TUI & Run | \[E\]xplain | \[M\]odify | \[C\]ancel?  
\[Confirm AI Cmd\] Choice (Y/Ys/Ym/Yi/E/M/C):  
Your options are:  
\* \*\*Y or yes\*\*: Execute the command. If the command is unknown to micro\_X's categorization system, you will be prompted to categorize it next (see section 4.3).  
\* \*\*Ys\*\*: Execute the command AND categorize it as \`simple\`.  
\* \*\*Ym\*\*: Execute the command AND categorize it as \`semi\_interactive\`.  
\* \*\*Yi\*\*: Execute the command AND categorize it as \`interactive\_tui\`.  
\* \*\*E or explain\*\*: Ask the AI to explain what the \`suggested\_command\` does. After the explanation, you will be prompted again to execute, modify, or cancel.  
  \`\`\`  
  ðŸ§  Asking AI to explain: suggested\_command  
  ðŸ’¡ AI Explanation:  
  The command 'suggested\_command' does XYZ...  
  Command to consider: suggested\_command  
  Action: \[Y\]es (Exec, prompt if new) | \[Ys\] Simple & Run | \[Ym\] Semi-Interactive & Run | \[Yi\] TUI & Run | \[M\]odify | \[C\]ancel?  
  \[Confirm AI Cmd\] Choice (Y/Ys/Ym/Yi/M/C):  
  \`\`\`  
\* \*\*M or modify\*\*: The \`suggested\_command\` will be loaded into your input field, allowing you to edit it before pressing Enter to submit the modified version.  
\* \*\*C or cancel (or N or no)\*\*: Abort the execution. The command will not run.

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.3. Command Categorization (for unknown direct commands or AI commands confirmed with 'Y')\*\*

When micro\_X encounters a command it hasn't seen before (either typed directly, or an AI-generated command confirmed with a simple 'Y' that isn't yet categorized), it will prompt you to categorize it. This helps micro\_X run the command appropriately.

\* \*\*Categories:\*\*  
\* \*\*\`simple\`\*\*: For commands that run quickly, produce non-interactive output, and don't require a persistent terminal session (e.g., \`ls\`, \`echo\`, \`cat somefile.txt\`). Chained commands like \`ls \-l | grep .txt\` are also often suitable here. These are executed directly, and their output is captured in the micro\_X output area.  
\* \*\*\`semi\_interactive\`\*\*: For commands that might run for a while, produce a lot of output, or have some minimal interactivity that doesn't require full TUI control (e.g., \`apt update\`, a long script, \`ping google.com\`). These are run in a new tmux window. Their output is captured and displayed in micro\_X after the command finishes or the tmux window closes/times out.  
 \* \*\*Smart Output Handling:\*\* If a \`semi\_interactive\` command produces output resembling a full-screen TUI application, micro\_X avoids displaying garbled output and suggests re-categorizing to \`interactive\_tui\`.  
\* \*\*\`interactive\_tui\`\*\*: For fully interactive terminal applications (e.g., \`nano\`, \`vim\`, \`htop\`, \`ssh user@host\`). These are run in a new tmux window that micro\_X effectively hands control to. When you exit the application (and thus the tmux window), you'll return to micro\_X.  
\* \*\*Categorization Prompt (Example for a directly typed unknown command):\*\*

Command 'my\_new\_script.sh \--verbose' is not categorized. Choose an action:  
1: simple (Direct output in micro\_X)  
2: semi\_interactive (Output in micro\_X after tmux run (may be interactive))  
3: interactive\_tui (Full interactive tmux session)  
M: Modify command before categorizing  
D: Execute as default 'semi\_interactive' (once, no save)  
C: Cancel categorization & execution  
\[Categorize\] Action (1-3/M/D/C):  
Enter your choice. If you choose 1, 2, or 3, the command and its category will be saved in \`config/user\_command\_categories.json\`.

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.4. Managing Command Categories (/command subsystem)\*\*

You can manage your saved command categorizations:

\* \`/command list\`: Shows all categorized commands (merged view of defaults and user settings).  
\* \`/command add "\<full\_command\_string\>" \<category\_name\_or\_number\>\`: Adds a new command or updates an existing one.  
\* Example: \`/command add "htop" interactive\_tui\`  
\* Example: \`/command add "my\_backup\_script.sh" 2\` (for \`semi\_interactive\`)  
\* \`/command remove "\<full\_command\_string\>"\`: Removes a command from your explicit user categorizations. It may then revert to a default category or become unknown.  
\* \`/command move "\<full\_command\_string\>" \<new\_category\_name\_or\_number\>\`: Moves a command to a different category in your settings.  
\* \`/command run \<cat\_num|cat\_name\> "\<cmd\>"\`: Force runs a command with a specific category for this instance without saving the categorization.  
\* \`/command help\`: Shows these usage instructions and category descriptions.  
Remember to quote command strings if they contain spaces.

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.5. Managing the Ollama Service (/ollama command)\*\*

micro\_X provides commands to manage the Ollama service it relies on for AI features:

\* \`/ollama status\`: Shows the current status of the Ollama executable, API responsiveness, the managed tmux session for \`ollama serve\`, and auto-start configuration.  
\* \`/ollama start\`: Attempts to start the managed \`ollama serve\` process in a tmux session if it's not already running and responsive.  
\* \`/ollama stop\`: Attempts to stop the managed \`ollama serve\` tmux session.  
\* \`/ollama restart\`: Attempts to stop and then restart the managed \`ollama serve\` process.  
\* \`/ollama help\`: Displays help information for these subcommands.

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.6. Using Utility Scripts (/utils command)\*\*

micro\_X comes with helpful utility scripts located in the \`utils/\` directory.

\* \*\*/utils list\*\*: Displays a list of available utility scripts.  
\* \*\*/utils \\\<script\\\_name\\\> \\\[args...\]\*\*: Executes the specified utility script.  
  \* Example: \`/utils generate\_tree\`  
  \* Example: \`/utils generate\_snapshot \--summary "My snapshot"\`  
\* \*\*/utils \\\<script\\\_name\\\> help\*\* (or \*\*-h\*\*, \*\*--help\*\*): Displays the help message for a specific utility script, showing its available arguments.  
  \* Example: \`/utils generate\_snapshot help\`

\#\#\#\# \*\*4.7. Chained Commands\*\*

micro\_X supports AI translation and execution of chained commands (e.g., \`ls \-l | grep .txt && echo "Found"\`).

\* When categorized, the entire chained command is treated as a single entity.  
\* The "dominant" category usually applies. If any part of a chain requires \`interactive\_tui\` (like \`nano\`), the whole chain will likely run best under \`interactive\_tui\`.

\#\#\# \*\*5. Developer Mode & Code Integrity\*\*

To enhance reliability and security, micro\_X implements a branch-aware system for developer mode and code integrity checks.

\* \*\*Purpose:\*\* This system aims to ensure that users running micro\_X from its stable (\`main\`) or \`testing\` branches are using verified and synchronized code. For developers, it provides a seamless experience on the development (\`dev\`) branch.  
\* \*\*Developer Mode (\`dev\` branch):\*\*  
  \* \*\*Activation:\*\* Automatically activated when micro\_X detects it is running from the \`dev\` Git branch, or if Git context is unavailable (e.g., not a Git repository).  
  \* \*\*Behavior:\*\* In this mode, startup integrity checks are informational or bypassed. micro\_X will run even if there are local uncommitted changes or if the \`dev\` branch has diverged from its remote counterpart.  
  \* \*\*Intention:\*\* This mode is designed for active development.  
\* \*\*Protected Mode (\`main\` and \`testing\` branches):\*\*  
  \* \*\*Activation:\*\* Active when micro\_X detects it is running from the \`main\` or \`testing\` Git branches.  
  \* \*\*Integrity Checks Performed at Startup:\*\*  
      1\.  \*\*Clean Working Directory:\*\* Verifies no uncommitted modifications to tracked files and no untracked files (not ignored by \`.gitignore\`).  
      2\.  \*\*Sync with Remote:\*\* Verifies the local branch is synchronized with its remote-tracking branch on \`origin\`. micro\_X attempts to \`git fetch\` for an up-to-date comparison.  
  \* \*\*Consequences of Failure:\*\*  
      \* If critical integrity issues are found (e.g., uncommitted local changes, local branch ahead of or diverged from remote), micro\_X will display an error message and \*\*halt execution\*\*. If the UI closes too quickly to read the message, check \`logs/micro\_x.log\` for details.  
      \* If the local branch is merely \*behind\* the remote (and \`allow\_run\_if\_behind\_remote\` is true in the configuration, which is the default), a warning will be displayed, and \`/update\` will be suggested. micro\_X will continue to run in this case.  
  \* \*\*User Action on Failure:\*\* See section "8. Troubleshooting Common Issues".  
\* \*\*Behavior on Other Branches/States:\*\*  
  \* \*\*Feature Branches (not \`dev\`, \`main\`, \`testing\`):\*\* Assumes a developer-like mode; integrity checks are informational and do not halt execution.  
  \* \*\*Detached HEAD State:\*\* Similar to other branches, assumes developer mode.  
\* \*\*Behavior if Not a Git Repository or \`git\` is Unavailable:\*\*  
  \* A warning message will be displayed.  
  \* Integrity checks will be disabled.  
  \* micro\_X will operate in a mode similar to "Developer Mode."

\#\#\# \*\*6. Working with tmux (for \`semi\_interactive\` and \`interactive\_tui\` commands)\*\*

micro\_X uses \`tmux\` (a terminal multiplexer) to run commands categorized as \`semi\_interactive\` or \`interactive\_tui\`.

\* \*\*If micro\_X was launched with \`./micro\_X.sh\` (Recommended):\*\*  
  \* micro\_X itself runs inside a main \`tmux\` session (e.g., named \`micro\_X\`).  
  \* \`semi\_interactive\` and \`interactive\_tui\` commands will create \*new windows within this main session\*.  
\* \*\*If micro\_X was launched with \`python3 main.py\` directly:\*\*  
  \* \`semi\_interactive\` and \`interactive\_tui\` commands will typically create \*new, independent \`tmux\` sessions\*.

\*\*Behavior of \`tmux\`-based commands:\*\*

\* \*\*\`interactive\_tui\` commands (e.g., \`nano\`, \`htop\`):\*\*  
  \* Your terminal will switch to show the interactive application in a new \`tmux\` window.  
  \* \*\*Exiting:\*\* Exit the application normally (e.g., \`Ctrl+X\` in \`nano\`) to close the \`tmux\` window and return to micro\_X.  
\* \*\*\`semi\_interactive\` commands (e.g., \`ping google.com\`):\*\*  
  \* These run in a \`tmux\` window, usually in the background.  
  \* Output is captured and displayed in micro\_X after completion or timeout.

\#\#\#\# \*\*6.1. Basic \`tmux\` Interaction (If you need to manually intervene)\*\*

The \`tmux\` prefix key is \`Ctrl+b\` by default.

\* \*\*Listing \`tmux\` Sessions & Windows:\*\*  
  \* From any terminal: \`tmux ls\` (lists sessions)  
  \* Inside a \`tmux\` session: \`tmux list-windows\` (lists windows in current session)  
  \* From outside, for a specific session: \`tmux list-windows \-t micro\_X\`  
\* \*\*Attaching to a \`tmux\` Session:\*\* \`tmux attach-session \-t micro\_X\`  
\* \*\*Detaching from Current \`tmux\` Session:\*\* \`Ctrl+b\`, then \`d\`.  
\* \*\*Switching Windows (within \`tmux\`):\*\* \`Ctrl+b\` then \`p\` (previous), \`n\` (next), or a window number (0, 1, ...).

\#\#\#\# \*\*6.2. Killing \`tmux\` Windows or Panes\*\*

If a command in a \`tmux\` window becomes unresponsive:

1\.  \*\*Identify Target:\*\* For \`interactive\_tui\`, you're likely in it. For \`semi\_interactive\`, list windows/sessions to find its name (e.g., \`micro\_x\_xxxx\`).  
2\.  \*\*Kill Current Window/Pane (if inside):\*\* Try \`Ctrl+C\` in the app. If unresponsive, \`Ctrl+b\` then \`x\` (confirm with \`y\`).  
3\.  \*\*Kill Specific Window by Name/ID:\*\* \`tmux kill-window \-t \<window\_index\_or\_name\>\`

\#\#\#\# \*\*6.3. Handling Processes that Lock Up \`tmux\` Windows\*\*

1\.  \*\*Identify PID:\*\* Detach from \`tmux\` (\`Ctrl+b d\`). Use \`ps aux | grep \<command\_name\>\` or \`htop\` in a standard terminal.  
2\.  \*\*Kill Process:\*\* \`kill \<PID\>\` (or \`kill \-9 \<PID\>\` with caution).  
3\.  \*\*Clean \`tmux\` Window:\*\* The \`tmux\` window might show "Pane is dead." Close it with \`Ctrl+b x\`.

\#\#\# \*\*7. Security Considerations\*\*

\* \*\*AI-Generated Commands:\*\* While micro\_X includes AI validation and a basic command sanitizer, \*\*AI can still generate unexpected or potentially harmful commands.\*\*  
\* \*\*Review and Understand:\*\* \*\*Crucially, always use the \`\[E\]xplain\` option\*\* in the command confirmation flow (section 4.2) for any AI-generated command if you are unsure about its function or impact.  
\* \*\*Modify or Cancel:\*\* Do not hesitate to \`\[M\]odify\` commands to your exact needs or \`\[C\]ancel\` them if they seem suspicious or incorrect.  
\* \*\*Startup Integrity Checks:\*\* The checks on \`main\` and \`testing\` branches provide an added layer of assurance. When these checks halt the application, it's a signal to review your local repository's state.  
\* \*\*User Responsibility:\*\* You are ultimately responsible for the commands executed in your environment.

\#\#\# \*\*8. Troubleshooting Common Issues\*\*

\* \*\*"Ollama Connection Error" / AI Features Not Working:\*\*  
  \* Ensure the Ollama application/service is running. Use \`/ollama status\`.  
  \* If not running, try \`/ollama start\`.  
  \* For WSL: Check \`OLLAMA\_HOST\` environment variable and Windows Firewall.  
\* \*\*AI Translations are Poor:\*\*  
  \* Rephrase \`/ai\` queries.  
  \* Ensure correct Ollama models are pulled and accessible.  
\* \*\*\`tmux\` Errors:\*\* Ensure \`tmux\` is installed and in PATH.  
\* \*\*Command Categorized Incorrectly:\*\* Use \`/command move\` or \`/command remove\`.  
\* \*\*micro\_X Halts on Startup with "Integrity Check Failed" (on \`main\` or \`testing\` branch):\*\*  
  \* \*\*Message: "Uncommitted local changes or untracked files detected."\*\*  
      \* \*Reason:\* You have uncommitted local modifications or new untracked files.  
      \* \*Solution:\* Open a standard terminal in your micro\_X project directory. Run \`git status\`. Commit, stash, or discard changes. For development, switch to the \`dev\` branch (\`git checkout dev\`).  
  \* \*\*Message: "Local branch has 'ahead'/'diverged' from 'origin/\<branch\>'."\*\*  
      \* \*Reason:\* Your local branch has commits not on the remote, or both have different new commits. This is considered a state that should be resolved before running on a protected branch.  
      \* \*Solution:\* \`git fetch origin\`. Then, depending on the situation:  
          \* If \*\*ahead\*\* and changes are intentional for this branch: \`git push origin \<branchname\>\`. If not, consider \`git reset \--hard origin/\<branchname\>\` (DISCARDS LOCAL COMMITS) or move changes to a feature branch.  
          \* If \*\*diverged\*\*: \`git rebase origin/\<branchname\>\` (and resolve conflicts) or \`git merge origin/\<branchname\>\`. Or, to discard local changes: \`git reset \--hard origin/\<branchname\>\`.  
          \* For development, switch to the \`dev\` branch.  
  \* \*\*Message: "Cannot reliably compare with remote. Status: no\_upstream/fetch\_failed/error."\*\*  
      \* \*Reason & Solution:\* Check internet, \`git branch \-vv\` for upstream tracking, \`git fetch origin\` for errors. Consult \`logs/micro\_x.log\`.  
  \* \*\*If micro\_X closes too quickly to read the error message on startup, always check \`logs/micro\_x.log\` for detailed error information.\*\*  
\* \*\*micro\_X shows warnings about being "behind remote" (on \`main\` or \`testing\` branch):\*\*  
  \* \*Reason:\* The remote repository has updates that your local branch does not.  
  \* \*Solution:\* Run \`/update\` from within micro\_X, or open a standard terminal in the project directory and run \`git pull origin \<branchname\>\`. micro\_X will typically continue to run in this scenario (if \`allow\_run\_if\_behind\_remote\` is true).

This guide should help you navigate and utilize the features of micro\_X more effectively. Happy shelling\!
