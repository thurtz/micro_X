# How to Run These Initial Tests

This document provides a starting point for a `pytest` testing suite for the micro_X project.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python Virtual Environment**: Ensure you have activated the virtual environment used for micro_X (e.g., `.venv`).
2.  **Install `pytest` and `pytest-mock`**: If you haven't already, install these packages:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest pytest-mock
    ```

## Directory Structure

Ensure your project has a `tests` directory at the root, structured like this:

```
micro_X/
├── modules/
│   ├── ai_handler.py
│   ├── category_manager.py
│   └── ... (other modules)
├── tests/
│   ├── __init__.py  (can be empty)
│   ├── conftest.py
│   ├── test_ai_handler.py
│   └── test_category_manager.py
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── ... (other project files)
```
The `tests/__init__.py` file helps Python recognize the `tests` directory as a package, though it's not strictly necessary for `pytest` discovery if `conftest.py` is present or paths are handled.

## Running the Tests

1.  **Navigate to the Project Root**: Open your terminal and change to the main `micro_X` directory (the one containing `main.py` and the `tests` folder).

2.  **Run `pytest`**:
    Execute the `pytest` command:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    Or, to be more verbose:
    ```bash
    pytest -v
    ```

    `pytest` should automatically discover the `tests` directory and the `test_*.py` files within it. The `conftest.py` file helps ensure that modules within your project (like those in the `modules` directory) can be imported correctly by the test files.

## Interpreting Output

* **Dots (`.`):** Each dot usually represents a passing test.
* **`F`:** Indicates a failed test.
* **`E`:** Indicates an error during a test (e.g., an unhandled exception in the test code itself or the code being tested).
* **Summary:** At the end, `pytest` will provide a summary of how many tests passed, failed, or resulted in errors.

## Next Steps

1.  **Expand Test Coverage**:
    * Add more test cases to `test_ai_handler.py` to cover other functions, especially those involving Ollama API calls (these will require mocking `ollama.chat` extensively).
    * Complete the tests for `category_manager.py`, covering `add_command_to_category`, `remove_command_from_category`, `load_and_merge_command_categories`, etc. Remember to mock file I/O.
    * Create test files for other modules (`ollama_manager.py`, `output_analyzer.py`).
    * Start writing tests for functions in `main.py`.

2.  **Refine Mocks**: Ensure your mocks accurately simulate the behavior of the components they replace.

3.  **Integration Tests**: Once you have good unit test coverage, start thinking about integration tests as described in the "Thoughts on an Automated Testing Suite for micro_X" document.

4.  **CI/CD**: Consider integrating these tests into a Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automatically run tests on every code change.

This initial setup provides a strong foundation for building a comprehensive and reliable testing suite for your micro_X project.
